This repository does not ship the badges to prevent abuse. Make sure that you manually copy the badges into this folder after cloning the repository.

You can find the badges in the MLSA Teams:
- [The new, Alpha and Beta badges](https://stdntpartners.sharepoint.com/sites/2021StudentAmbassadorSummit/Shared%20Documents/Digital%20Swag!/Teams%20Profile%20Badge) for the new, Alpha and Beta badges.
- [The Gold badge](https://stdntpartners.sharepoint.com/sites/GoldStudentPartners/Shared%20Documents/General/MSLearn_SA_Profile_Badge_Overlay_GOLD.png).

Make sure to leave the names as they are (`MSLearn_SA_Profile_Badge_Overlay_(GENERIC|ALPHA|BETA|GOLD).png`).
