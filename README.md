# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA) Badge Maker

In February 2021, overlays for the milestone badges were distributed by the CPMs inside the MLSA community. Some members still rock them in their profiles which is great because it allows members to spot their milestones and it encourages user personalization.

Since not all users are familiar with image manipulation tools like Paint.NET or GIMP, I decided to develop a web app that allows all members to 'badgify' their avatars.
This way, we will make the badges more accessible and inclusive for people who would like to add their milestone badge to their profile picture with ease.

The web app automatically determines the corresponding user's milestone and applies the overlay to the user avatar.
Once you have generated your image, you can either download the image or let the tool upload it to your MLSA Teams account.

It's hosted on Azure Static Web Apps and built with Blazor, Azure Functions and MS Graph: https://badge.mlsa.live/
